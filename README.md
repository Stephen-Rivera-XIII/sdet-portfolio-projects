# SDET Portfolio Projects

This repository is a curated showcase of my software development engineer in test (SDET) capabilities. It includes practical examples of:

- Unit testing with Jasmine (JavaScript)
- End-to-end browser automation using Playwright
- API testing with RESTful services
- CI/CD test execution via GitHub Actions

The goal of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate my testing proficiency to potential employers and freelance clients
- Provide clear, readable examples of well-structured test code
- Reflect my ability to work with real-world testing tools and workflows

Each directory includes:

- Test cases and tested code (when applicable)
- Supporting utilities or setup files
- Minimal documentation for context

Visit the `docs/` folder for a high-level roadmap, ideas, and reflections.
